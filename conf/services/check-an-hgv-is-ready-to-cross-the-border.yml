    description: >-
      Items in the “What happens next” section are incorrectly laid out as a list, 
      and then a mix of p, strong, br, small to mimic what should be a heading-level 3 and a paragraph. 
      This prevents a screen reader user from navigating by headings and makes the page harder to read.
